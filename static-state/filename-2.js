The atmosphere felt oppressive. I made this bench, brought it over to school and chained it around a column. It has two modes: bench and ashtray (made from groin protector). The building security (male) approached me as soon as I entered the building and asked if I had permission chain down the bench. I, aggro-defensively, lied that I had. Later I had to speak to the director of the school (female), to whom I presented the bench as a public benefit and so the bench stayed.
